# Fix Package.json Build Script

## Problem Statement

The current package.json build script is causing Vercel deployment failures with routes manifest errors. The build script contains error bypassing mechanisms that prevent proper Next.js build completion:

1. **Current problematic build script**: Uses `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true next build` which may skip critical build validations
2. **Routes manifest error**: Vercel expects a clean, complete Next.js build process to generate proper routing manifests
3. **Error masking**: Previous error bypassing (`|| echo 'Ignoring build errors'`) prevents visibility into real build issues
4. **Deployment blockers**: Vercel's build process requires standard Next.js build output without modifications

The build must complete successfully without artificial error suppression to ensure proper deployment.

## Solution Overview

1. **Restore Standard Build Process**: Replace custom build script with standard `next build`
2. **Remove Error Bypassing**: Eliminate all error ignoring mechanisms that mask build failures
3. **Fix Underlying Issues**: Address root causes that required error bypassing in the first place
4. **Validate Clean Build**: Ensure build completes successfully with standard Next.js process
5. **Test Vercel Compatibility**: Verify build output is compatible with Vercel's deployment requirements

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Build Script Cleanup
1. **Update package.json scripts**:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "next dev",
       "build": "next build",
       "start": "next start",
       "lint": "next lint"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Remove environment variable overrides**:
   - Remove `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` from build process
   - Ensure proper environment validation occurs during build

3. **Clean up legacy scripts**:
   - Remove `build:strict` if it exists
   - Standardize all build-related commands

### Phase 2: Next.js Configuration Review
1. **Review next.config.js settings**:
   - Ensure ESLint and TypeScript settings are appropriate for production
   - Remove overly permissive build error ignoring
   - Keep only necessary configuration for deployment

2. **Update build configurations**:
   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     eslint: {
       // Allow build to complete but show warnings
       ignoreDuringBuilds: false,
     },
     typescript: {
       // Allow build to complete but show warnings
       ignoreBuildErrors: false,
     },
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Root Cause Resolution
1. **Address TypeScript errors**:
   - Fix remaining explicit any types with proper interfaces
   - Resolve import/export type mismatches
   - Ensure all components have proper type definitions

2. **Resolve ESLint violations**:
   - Fix unused variable warnings by removing or prefixing with underscore
   - Address React hooks dependency warnings
   - Clean up import statements

3. **Fix build-blocking issues**:
   - Ensure all required dependencies are properly installed
   - Resolve any module resolution errors
   - Fix any circular dependency issues

### Phase 4: Build Validation
1. **Test clean build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Must complete with exit code 0
   - No error suppression or bypassing
   - Generate complete build output

2. **Verify build artifacts**:
   - Check `.next/` directory contains complete build output
   - Verify routes manifest is generated properly
   - Ensure static assets are built correctly

3. **Test production mode**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Application must start successfully from build output
   - All routes must be accessible
   - No runtime errors in production mode

### Phase 5: Deployment Readiness
1. **Environment variable validation**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are properly configured
   - Test with production-like environment settings
   - Validate Supabase and other service connections

2. **Performance optimization**:
   - Review bundle sizes and optimize if necessary
   - Ensure code splitting is working correctly
   - Verify static generation is functioning

3. **Vercel compatibility check**:
   - Test build output structure matches Vercel expectations
   - Verify no custom build modifications conflict with Vercel
   - Ensure all API routes are properly detected
