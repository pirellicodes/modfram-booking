# Fix TypeScript and ESLint Errors

## Problem Statement

The Vercel deployment is failing due to TypeScript and ESLint errors that are blocking the build process. Common issues include:

- Unused imports that ESLint flags as errors
- Explicit `any` types that violate TypeScript strict mode
- Missing dependencies or type definitions
- Type errors from recent refactor changes
- ESLint configuration conflicts with Next.js 15.5.2

The build needs to pass both TypeScript compilation and ESLint checks to deploy successfully on Vercel.

## Solution Overview

1. **Audit Current Errors**: Run build locally to identify all TypeScript and ESLint errors
2. **Fix Unused Imports**: Remove or comment unused imports across all files  
3. **Replace Any Types**: Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all `any` types
4. **Resolve Missing Dependencies**: Add missing packages and type definitions
5. **Update ESLint Config**: Ensure compatibility with Next.js 15.5.2 and project requirements
6. **Validate Build**: Confirm clean build locally before deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Build Tools
- Next.js 15.5.2 build process must pass
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint configuration alignment with project standards
- Vercel deployment compatibility

### Code Quality Standards
- No unused variables or imports
- Explicit typing for all function parameters and returns
- Proper interface definitions for complex objects
- Consistent ESLint rule enforcement

### Dependencies
- All required packages in package.json
- Type definitions for third-party libraries
- Proper version compatibility across dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Error Discovery
1. Run `npm run build` to capture all current errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to identify ESLint violations
3. Document error categories and affected files
4. Prioritize errors that block build vs warnings

### Phase 2: Import Cleanup
1. Remove unused imports from all components and utilities
2. Keep imports that may appear unused but are required for types
3. Use ESLint disable comments sparingly for edge cases
4. Verify no functional regressions from import removals

### Phase 3: Type Safety Improvements
1. Replace `any` types with proper interfaces:
   - `BookingWithClient` for booking data
   - `EventTypeWithParsedFields` for event types
   - Location objects with union types
   - API response interfaces
2. Add type guards where needed for runtime type checking
3. Use generic types for reusable components
4. Ensure all async functions have proper return types

### Phase 4: Missing Dependencies
1. Add missing `@types/*` packages for type definitions
2. Install peer dependencies flagged by build process
3. Update package.json with correct version ranges
4. Resolve any package version conflicts

### Phase 5: ESLint Configuration
1. Update `.eslintrc.json` for Next.js 15.5.2 compatibility
2. Configure rules for TypeScript strict mode
3. Set appropriate rules for React hooks and components
4. Balance code quality with development productivity

### Phase 6: Build Validation
1. Clean `npm run build` with zero errors
2. Clean `npm run lint` with zero violations  
3. Test critical application flows still work
4. Verify Vercel preview deployment succeeds

## Self-Validation

### Build Success Criteria
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with exit code 0
- [ ] `npm run lint` shows no errors or warnings
- [ ] `npm run type-check` (if available) passes
- [ ] All TypeScript files compile without errors

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] No `any` types remain except in justified edge cases
- [ ] All imports are used or properly justified
- [ ] Interface definitions cover all complex object shapes
- [ ] Function signatures have explicit return types

### Functional Validation
- [ ] Application starts without console errors
- [ ] Key user flows work (bookings, event types, integrations)
- [ ] No runtime TypeScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Database operations and API calls function correctly

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Vercel build preview deploys successfully
- [ ] No build warnings that could become errors
- [ ] Performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Environment variables and dependencies properly configured

### Documentation
- [ ] Document any ESLint rule exceptions with justification
- [ ] Update README if new dependencies or scripts added
- [ ] Record any breaking changes or migration notes
- [ ] Create commit messages that clearly describe fixes made
