## Styling & UX Improvements

- **Cal.com-inspired Design** - Clean, modern interface that mirrors Cal.com's aesthetic
- **Consistent Component Style** - Unified look and feel across all pages
- **Dark/Light Mode Support** - Theme-aware components
- **Loading & Error States** - Graceful handling of all data states
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

1. **Type Safety** - Some components use `any` types where Supabase response structure is uncertain
2. **Chart Responsiveness** - Additional work needed for smaller screens
3. **Calendar Integration** - Further work needed for external calendar sync
4. **Email Templating** - Currently supports basic templates, could be expanded

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Supabase is properly configured with tables matching the schema in `src/lib/types/database.ts`
2. Set up environment variables for Supabase connections
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start development server

## Conclusion

The refactored dashboard provides a complete, Cal.com-inspired admin interface that handles all aspects of booking management with a clean, modern UI. The implementation follows best practices for React and Next.js development, with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and user experience.
